## Compile A Programme

### 1. src file management and include directories

- Source Files shall be put into `src` directory or otherwise somewhere newly created and added to `source directories` (`源位置`) in `path and symbols` in `C/C++ Settings`.

- The included directories shall be started with `${ProjDirPath}/` without a slash '/' at the beginning. Or alternatively, check `is a workplace_loc` (是一个工作空间路径) and start with `/${ProjName}/`. <b>Such including shall be applied to all languages.</b>

### 2. gcc optimization flag
`-Og`, `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`, are different levels of compilation optimization, where can always lead to equivalent results and speed up the executable step by step.

These flags are set in `C/C++ Settings`, `C/C++ Build`, `Settings`, `Optimization`. 

However, `-Ofast` does a lot more aggressively, which affects the precision of floating point calculation by large by turning on the flag `-ffast-math`, which may potentially decay the fp operators.
The optimization can be viewed in the following web page:
[-ffast-math](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#index-ffast-math)


If you want speed regardless of fp precision, just put `-ffast-math`, and the error may be enlarged to 10^{-8}*operand.


### 3. Memory Allocation and Linker Script
<b>notice</b>: heap size is configured before code generation in `BSP`, `configuration.xml`. (see `1. start_a_new_project.md`)

<b>Linker section setting shall be performed manually if "layout section automatically" option is selected.</b> Therefore, we shall modify the linker section in "${ProjName}/script/*.id" after code generation process and then build.
